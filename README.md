## Analysis
The time series analysis focused on identifying trends in vehicle listing prices over time. The analysis involved the following steps:

##Data cleaning and preparation: 
The data was cleaned to remove any errors or inconsistencies. The data was then prepared for analysis by converting categorical variables to numerical variables and handling missing values.

## Exploratory data analysis: 
The data was explored using visualizations and descriptive statistics to gain an understanding of the distribution of the data and identify any potential patterns or trends.

## Time series decomposition: 
The time series data was decomposed into trend, seasonal, and residual components using techniques such as moving averages and exponential smoothing. This helped to identify the underlying trends in the data.

## Forecasting: 
The time series data was used to forecast future vehicle listing prices. This was done using techniques such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models and exponential smoothing models.

## Results
The time series analysis revealed that there is a clear trend of increasing vehicle listing prices over time. The analysis also identified a seasonal pattern in the data, with prices tending to be higher in the summer months.

## Conclusion
The time series analysis of vehicle listing data provides valuable insights into the trends and patterns of vehicle prices over time. This information can be used by businesses and individuals to make informed decisions about vehicle purchases and sales.
